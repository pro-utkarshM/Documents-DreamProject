    <para>This book is written to document the 7.0 series of the T2
    System Development Environment (SDE), but is intended to be useful
    for reference with earlier versions such as 6.0 and 2.1. Where
    incompatible changes have been implemented we tried to outline
    them.</para>

    <title>Audience</title>
    
    <para>This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to
    use T2 as operating system or system development environment for
    custom Linux appliances - such as: router, firewall, network
    attached storage (NAS), desktop, server or embedded boards and
    products.</para>

    <title>How to Read this Book</title>

    <para>This book aims to be useful to people of widely different
    backgrounds&mdash;from people who only intend to install final
    products based on T2, up to experienced system administrators,
    system integrators and developers who need an inside into every
    detail of the T2 environment. Depending on your own background,
    certain chapters may be more or less important: While
    administrators and developers might be most interested in quickly
    getting to the details in <xref linkend="t2.build"/> and <xref
    linkend="t2.inside"/>, end-users can rather skip over the T2
    internals and start reading <xref linkend="t2.install"/> and <xref
    linkend="t2.config"/>.</para>

    <para>This book started out as bits of documentation written by
    Ren√© Rebe, which were then gradually updated and enhanced
    according to the changes and progress made in T2 as well as user
    and developer feedback. As such, it has always been under a free
    license.  (See <xref linkend="t2.copyright"/>.)  In fact, the
    book was written in the public eye, as a part of T2. This means
    two things:</para>

        <para>You can distribute and make changes to this book however
          you wish&mdash;its under a free license.  Of course,
          rather than distribute your own private version of this

    <title>Acknowledgments</title>

    <para>This book would not be possible - nor very useful - if T2
    did not exist. For that, the authors would like to thank Clifford
    Wolf for starting ROCK Linux and all the countless people who
    contributed to it and T2 over the last decade.</para>

    <para>We also would like to thank all who contributed to this book
    with informal reviews, suggestions, and fixes: While this is
    undoubtedly not a complete list, this book would be incomplete and
    incorrect without the help of: Lars Kuhtz, Valentin Ziegler, Urs
    Pfister, and the entire T2 community.</para>
    
    <para>Special thanks to Ben Collins-Sussman, Brian W. Fitzpatrick,
    and C. Michael Pilato for their outstanding XML Docbook setup as
    created for the Subversion book, which is also used to transform
    this book into the final PDF, PostScript(tm) and HTML form.</para>
    
    <para>We hope you find this book a joyful read. Joy and
    collaboration is what made GNU/Linux great and it is in that
    spirit T2 has been created and evolves!</para>
