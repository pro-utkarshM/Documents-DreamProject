This directory (distcc/doc/example) contains example configuration
files for the distccd service that need to be installed manually when
distccd is installed via "make install".  For a typical Linux system,
these files would need to be installed in the following locations:

   /etc/init.d/distcc
   /etc/logrotate.d/distcc
   /etc/inetd.d/distcc
   /etc/defaults/distcc
   /etc/services              # Just append one line to this file.
   /etc/hosts.allow           # Just append one line to this file.

The details of how to set up services are quite system-specific, so
depending on your system you may need to do things differently.

If you install distccd using the RPM or Debian package, appropriate
versions of those files will be installed automatically, so you don't
need to install them manually, and you don't need to bother looking at
the files in this directory (distcc/doc/example).  However, you may need
to edit the /etc/hosts.allow file.

In addition to the above-mentioned configuration files, you may also
need to edit the following three files in distcc's sysconf directory
(/etc/distcc, or /usr/local/etc/distcc, or some other location, depending
on how your configured distcc).  Example versions of these configuration
files get installed automatically by "make install" and by the RPM and
Debian packages.  Two configuration files on the server machines are
used by the init script for starting distccd:

   /etc/distcc/commands.allow.sh
   /etc/distcc/clients.allow

One configuration file on the client machine is used by distcc:

   /etc/distcc/hosts
